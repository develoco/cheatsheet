# React Native 0.60

Initialize with _npm_ rather than _yarn_

    npx react-native init RNZeroSixty --npm

Presumably still need Facebook's `watchman` 
Presumably we now need `cocoapods`

Optionally start the bundler and run in the simulator

     npx react-native start
     npx react-native run-ios

# Compile from source with Xcode

From the source we will only need the following folders:

    Libraries
    React
    ReactCommon
    scripts
